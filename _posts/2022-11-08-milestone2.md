In the above graphs, we can see what we wuld expect from these charts. Regarding distance, we see that the goal rate is highest closest t the goal and decreases somewhat linearly as distance incereases. It's quite obvious that this would be true as we would expect more goals the closer a player's shot is. In contrast, the goal rate of the angle appears normally distributed with higher tails on both extremes. This also would be what is expected. Obviously, the best place to shoot, is right infront of the goalie. However, during passing plays, angles that are more extereme are likely to result in goals too.

iii.

The empty net shot/goal histogram is what we expect. Players take less shots very close since there is no goalie, resulting in the vast majority of shots being taken a bit further out but still in the zone. However, we see that the distribution of goals remains somewhat constant. The majority of goals are being scored in the offensive half, but there are a lot being scored very far out. This can most likely be attributed errors in the the coordinates.
